# Safety philosophy

The safety philosophy is a short, written statement of the relationship that an
organization's management desires between safety and other organizational goals.

The safety philosophy establishes the principles upon which the more extensive
safety policies and standards are built and assessed, and provides a succinct
statement of how management wants employees to make safety-related decisions and
to act.

Examples of general principles that might be part of the safety philosophy:

1. All injuries and accidents are preventable. 

2. Safety and productivity go hand in hand. Improving safety management leads to improving other quality and performance factors. Maximum business performance requires safety. 

3. Safety has to be built into a product or the design of a service. Adding it later will be less effective and more expensive. After-the-fact assurance cannot guarantee a safe design where safety is not already present. It is better to build safety in than try to ensure it after the fact.  

4. The goal of accident/incident causality analysis is to determine why the loss (or near loss) occurred so that appropriate changes can be made rather than to find someone or something to blame. 

5. Incidents and accidents are an important window into systems that are not operating safely and should trigger comprehensive causal analysis and improvement actions. 

6. Safety information must be surfaced without fear. Safety analysis will be conducted without blame. 

7. Safety commitment, openness and honesty is valued and rewarded in the organization.

8. Effective communication and the sharing of information is essential to preventing losses.
